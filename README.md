# PGN Docs

This repo contains the public documentation for the Public Goods Network (PGN).

## What is PGN

Public Goods Network (PGN) is a low-cost Layer 2 (L2) built on top of Ethereum for supporting public goods. It is built on the [Bedrock](https://stack.optimism.io/docs/releases/bedrock/explainer/) version of [OP Stack](https://stack.optimism.io/), in collaboration with Optimism.

## Docs stack

We utilized [Nextra](https://nextra.site) to build these docs, and [Vercel](https://vercel.com/templates/next.js/documentation-starter-kit) to deploy.
